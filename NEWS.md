# stelfi 0.0.1

## Initial release

Model fitting functions include

 + `fit_hawkes()` and `fit_hawkes_cbf()` to fit self-exciting Hawkes processes to temporal point pattern data
 + `fit_lgcp()` fits a log-Gaussian Cox process to either spatial or spatiotemporal point pattern data. If a spatiotemporal model is fitted an AR1 process is assumed for the temporal progression
 + `fit_mlgcp()` fits a joint likelihood model between the point locations and mark(s)
 + `fit_stelfi()` fits self-exciting spatiotemporal Hawkes models to point pattern data. The self-excitement is Gaussian in space and exponentially decaying over time. In addition, a GMRF can be included to account for latent spatial dependency
